	<h2> Assignment: Map your route from home to school </h2>
	<p> Start from the center (home) and manipulate the discs to create a word-association route to BU. What kinds of connections do you make? </p>

   <p> My goal was to visualize what it's like to navigate with no sense of direction. When I bike through Boston, I move between familiar points with little awareness of how they fit on a map. The spoke-like words represent possible thoughts. The concentric circles describe geographical features along the way. Moving outward leads to BU, but the path reveals more about your mind than it does about your geographical location. </p>
