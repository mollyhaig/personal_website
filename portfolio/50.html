	<h1> 50 Iterations </h1>

	<h2> Assignment Part I: Create 50 iterations of a poster </h2>
	<p> Based on a 1951 concert poster by Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockman </p>
	<h2> Assignment Part II: Present the posters in a way that relates to their content. </h2>
	<p> Posters are animated to go with a recording of Alexander Brailowsky (the soloist advertised in the original poster) playing Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor (one of the pieces from the original poster). </p>
